The wedge has an inclination angle θ and the small block is initially at rest relative to the wedge. The system is released from rest in a uniform gravitational field g. There is no friction between the block and the wedge either.\n\nWhich of the following statements is correct concerning the horizontal component of the acceleration of the small block relative to the ground?",
